                <p>Most of us are casual moviegoers, movie lovers, and fans, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is that the feeling of movement when we see a still, a frame so beautiful that it makes us think to imagine the world behind that camera.</p>
